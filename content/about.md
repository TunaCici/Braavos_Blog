Picture of me with an R35 (i have obsession)

Hi I'm Tuna, your underground software dealer from [Night City](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Night_City).
If you would like to see some of my work, either visit one of the above [contact] links or my [GitHub](https://github.com/TunaCici) thingy.

I **love**:

- Desiging software [architectures] & vibing with the code (C++ my beloved)
- Low-level [embedded] programming ("iso C will never destroyed")
- Tinkering with hardware (my good-old raspberry pi & poor-old 'gaming' pc)
- Illustrations & Content-creation (i'm no good at it, but nvm that)
- Ricing the hell out of my Archy [Linux] machine (no i won't say it)

*and when I say "love", I mean "addicted"*

I am **inspired** by these people (not limited to):

- [Onur Mutlu](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/omutlu) (a god of [modern] computer architecture imo)
- [Steve Jobs](https://www.apple.com/stevejobs) (not much to say here)
- [Julia Evans](https://twitter.com/b0rk) (awesome software illustrations & writing)
- [Тsфdiиg](https://twitter.com/tsoding) (such a cool & fun person - watch his [videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/tsoding/videos))
- [Asahi Lina](https://twitter.com/LinaAsahi) (M1 GPU driver for Linux on Macs - i'm a 'fan')
- [Call Me Kevin](https://www.youtube.com/@CallMeKevin) (the definition of chaotic good)
- [Daenerys Targaryen](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen) (fire & blood)
- [Fred Again](https://www.fredagain.com) (i adore his work & helped me through some tough times)

Software I really like (#notsponsored):

- [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org) (open source machine emulator and virtualizer)
- [UTM](https://getutm.app) (virtual machine manager for Apple Devices)
- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty) (an amazing cross-platform terminal emulator)
- [exa](https://the.exa.website) (modern & colorful replacement for `ls`)

Hardware I adore (#notsponsored, duh):

- Almost anything [Apple](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/) makes
- [Mohit Bhoite's](https://twitter.com/MohitBhoite), *what he calls*, sculptures. They are **extremely** aesthetic
