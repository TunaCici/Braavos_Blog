<div class="py2">

  <p>
    You can try to contact me via one of my social medias given above (altough i prefer Discord).
    But if you are in a hurry, you can use this _Formspree_ HTML form to send me an email. Don't worry,
    I will receive it "instantly" and reply as soon as possible.
  </p>

  <form action="https://formspree.io/f/xjvqypar" method="POST" class="form-stacked">
    <input type="text" name="email" class="field-light" placeholder="Email Address">
    <textarea type="text" name="content" class="field-light" rows="5" placeholder="What would you like to say?"></textarea>
    <input type="hidden" name="_next" value="https://joonas.fi/contact-thanks.html" />
    <input type="hidden" name="_subject" value="New submission!" />
    <input type="text" name="_gotcha" style="display:none" />
