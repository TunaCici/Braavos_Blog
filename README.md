![Build](https://github.com/joonas-fi/joonas.fi-blog/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

What
====

This is source code for my [personal blog](https://joonas.fi/), powered by Jekyll.

It gets built as a static site, shoved inside a Docker image with a bare static HTTP server.

Dev mode
========

For testing the content before making an actual build, run:

```
$ bob dev
```

Bob will give you pro-tips on previewing.
