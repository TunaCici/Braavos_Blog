What
====

This is source code for my [personal blog](https://joonas.fi/), powered by Jekyll.

It gets built as a static site, shoved inside a Docker image with a bare static HTTP server.

Dev mode

For testing the content before making an actual build, run:

```
$ ./preview.sh
Hit this URL in your momma's browser: joonas-blog.dev-laptop.xs.fi
